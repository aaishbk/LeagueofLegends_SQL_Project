# League of Legends SQL Project
For this SQL project, I found a database on the champions of league of legends, showcasing different statistics like winrate, playrate, role and more
I decided to add two of my own columns of data; region & species based on my own knowledge & passion for the lore of the champions.
This then made for more interesting queries to be made in the project.
If you are knowledgable in the lore of the game, the queries will make sense to you.
Even if you are not I have written detailed explanations for each query.
